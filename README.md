# Welcome to the “How to Wiki” Workshop Repository!

This repository contains all files and resources from the "How to Wiki?" workshops at the BFH European Meetup, designed to introduce MINT students from the iGEM competition to the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

## About the BFH Meetup

What started as a late-night idea in Paris 2023 quickly became reality when the founders organized the first ever BFH European Meetup. This event brings iGEM teams together early in the season, fostering collaboration, friendships, and the exchange of feedback in a fun and engaging environment.

- **2024:** The inaugural event took place in Bielefeld.
- **2025:** The second meetup took place in Frankfurt.

### Workshop Projects

- **2024 (Bielefeld):**  
  Introduced the basics of web design, focusing on colors, fonts, typefaces, and content spacing. Participants learned the essentials of HTML and CSS through hands-on examples and live demonstrations.

- **2025 (Frankfurt):**  
  Builds on the previous year, continuing to present HTML and CSS fundamentals to a new group of iGEM students. The workshop materials are updated and tailored for the 2025 event.

Each years folder contains all the necessary files for that year's workshop, including example HTML pages, CSS stylesheets, and any supporting assets.

I hope these resources help you get started with web design for your iGEM project wiki!
