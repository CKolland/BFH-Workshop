        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) and grease a 9-inch springform pan. In a medium bowl, combine graham
            cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, melted butter, and optional cinnamon. Press the mixture onto the
            bottom of the prepared pan evenly. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and 1 cup granulated sugar until
            smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in sour cream, flour, vanilla,
            cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cayenne until fully combined. Pour the filling over the crust. Bake for 55-60
            minutes until set. Turn off the oven, leave the cheesecake inside with the door ajar for 1 hour, then cool
            completely. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight. Remove the sides of the pan, slice, and serve
            chilled. Adjust cayenne for desired spice level. Enjoy!
